## Experience

* **Researcher in Experimental High Energy Physics** (100%), European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland (*04.2018 - 09.2019*)

  * **CMS Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL)**: During data taking, provided prompt feedback on sub-detector of CMS experiment, HCAL, by visualizing the trigger primitives (TPs) distribution as well as pulse timing in different channels using ROOT (a C++ framework), and interpreting the abnormal. During detector upgrading, studied on the commissioning of upgraded TPs and the impact on HCAL.
  * **Search for supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV**: Contributed to estimate the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) multijet contamination (background noise) by implementing a data-driven method called Rebalance-and-Smear.


* **Teaching Assistant** (50%), University of California, Riverside, United States (*09.2016 - 04.2018*)

  Tutored in General Physics Laboratories and instructed in General Physics Discussions.

* **Research Assistant** (100%), National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, Nanjing, China (*06.2015 - 06.2016*)

  Worked on projects of nanomaterial growth and spintronics characterization.



## Projects

* **Sichuan Xinwang bank Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Algorithm Competition 2020** (*07.2020*):

  Interpreted temporal signals collected from accelerometer sensor as pixels in several channels of an image, HAR in the competition thus could be viewed as an image classication task. Sticking on the idea, standardized the data by resampling with FFT, then achieved a baseline with an autoencoder using relatively shallow convolutional neural network. To alleviate the overfit, dropout, weight decay and early stopping methods were employed, finally, the online accuracy was improved up to 75%.

* **Tencent Advertising Algorithm Competition 2020** (*06.2020*):

  Interpreted user temporal behaviors (clicking ads) as a sentence, profiling (grouping) users problem in the competition thus could be considered as a text classication task. Based on the idea, then decreased the dimensionalities of over 3 million (one-hot) into 32 by embedding the ad ids using Word2Vec, consequently, a baseline for the classier with LSTM neural network was realized.

* **Ortografix** (*05.2020 - 06.2020*):

  Transcripted normal English spelling into SoundSpel by implementing a character-level Seq2Seq model with PyTorch as a baseline.  Successfully improved average normalized edit distance (metrics) to over 90% by modifying the PyTorch architecture in the decoder, implementing bidirectional GRU with attention.

* **Driver Workload Prediction** (*06.2020*)

  Developed a scikit-learn pipeline with SVM classifiers to predict the workload that a driver is experiencing using their physiological data.  Weakened the class imbalance by introducing class weights in the loss, improved kappa score (metrics) to over 50% in the test by implementing PCA, regularization and cross-validation tricks.

* **Shoot The Apple** (*03.2020 - 06.2020*):

  Developed a FPS game based on Unity, C# scripts and realized a real-time human-machine interactive stress level controller by employing facial expression detection via device camera, collected 5/5 good ratings in the test by raising questionnaires.

* **Multilingual** (*03.2020 - 06.2020*):

  Developed a web interface with Flask and Bootstrap to (mainly) query and modify a MySQL lexical database.
