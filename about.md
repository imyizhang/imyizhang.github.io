## Education

* **MSc in Computer Science**, University of Geneva, Switzerland (*09.2019 - present*)

  **Coursework**: 

* **PhD in Experimental High Energy Physics** (***suspension***), University of California, Riverside, United States (*06.2018 - 09.2019*)

* **MSc in Physics**, University of California, Riverside, United States (*09.2016 - 06.2018*)

* **BSc in Physics**, Nanjing University, China (*09.2011 - 07.2015*)



## Projects

* **Sichuan Xinwang bank Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Algorithm Competition 2020** (*07.2020*):

  Simply interpreted temporal signals collected from accelerometer sensor as pixels of an image, HAR in the challenge thus could be transformed into image classication task. Sticking on the idea, standardized the data by resampling with a fixed number of sampling points, then achieved a baseline with an autoencoder using relatively shallow convolutional neural network. To fix the overfit issue, dropout, weight decay and early stopping methods were employed, finally, the online accuracy was improved up to 75%.

* **Tencent Advertising Algorithm Competition 2020** (*06.2020*): 

  Interpreted user temporal behaviors (clicking ads) as a sentence, profiling (grouping) users problem in the challenge thus could be considered as a text classication task. Based on the idea, then decreased the dimensionalities of over 3 million (one-hot) into 32 by embedding the ad ids using Word2Vec, consequently, a baseline for the classier with LSTM neural network was realized.

* **Ortografix** (*05.2020 - 06.2020*): 

  Transcripted normal English spelling into SoundSpel by implementing a character-level Seq2Seq model with PyTorch as a baseline.  Successfully improved average normalized edit distance (metrics) to over 90% by modifying the PyTorch architecture in the decoder, implementing bidirectional GRU with attention.

* **Driver Workload Prediction** (*06.2020*)

  Developed a scikit-learn pipeline with SVM classifiers to predict the workload that a driver is experiencing using their physiological data.  Weakened the class imbalance by introducing class weights in the loss, improved kappa score (metrics) to over 50% in the test by implementing PCA, regularization and cross-validation tricks.

* **Shoot The Apple** (*03.2020 - 06.2020*): 

  Developed a FPS game based on Unity, C# scripts and realized a real-time human-machine interactive stress level controller by employing facial expression detection via device camera, collected 5/5 good ratings in the test by raising questionnaires.

* **Multilingual** (*03.2020 - 06.2020*): 

  Developed a web interface with Flask and Bootstrap to (mainly) query and modify a MySQL lexical database.



## Experience

* **Researcher in Experimental High Energy Physics**, European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Geneva, Switzerland (*04.2018 - 09.2019*)
  * **CMS HCAL**: During the data taking and detector upgrade, provided prompt feedback on sub-detector, HCAL, by visualizing the trigger primitives distribution as well as pulse timing in dierent channels using ROOT (a C++ framework), pointing out and interpreting the abnormal.
  * **Search for New Physics**: Estimated the QCD background (noise) by implementing a data-driven method called Rebalance-and-Smear.

* **Teaching Assistant**, University of California, Riverside, United States (*09.2016 - 04.2018*)

  Introduced a series of methods to physics experiments design, such as control variate method, helped the undergraduates to exercise the experiments and taught them basic analysis methods, such as error analysis.

* **Research Assistant**, National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, Nanjing, China (*08.2014 - 06.2016*)

  Worked on projects of spintronics and materials
